## 🚨 Critical Issues Blocking Public Launch

### 1. Payment Configuration (BLOCKING)
```
❌ TON_API_KEY not configured
❌ TON_WALLET still placeholder address
❌ No real payment testing completed
```

**Impact**: Payment system will fail for real transactions
**Fix Required**: Get TON API key from @tonapibot, set real wallet address

### 2. Admin Access (BLOCKING)
```
❌ ADMIN_USER_IDS = [] (empty list)
❌ No platform moderation capability
❌ Cannot handle user reports or abuse
```

**Impact**: No way to moderate content or handle user issues
**Fix Required**: Add admin Telegram user IDs to configuration

### 3. Code Quality (IMPORTANT)
```
⚠️ 326 LSP diagnostic errors remaining
⚠️ Null pointer exceptions in message handling
⚠️ Type checking errors with user objects
```

**Impact**: Potential crashes during user interactions
**Fix Required**: Address remaining null safety issues

## 🛠️ Immediate Action Items
