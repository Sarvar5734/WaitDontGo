### Design Patterns

**Service Architecture**
- Modular design separating keep-alive functionality from core bot operations
- HTTP server provides external health monitoring capabilities
- Logging framework integration for operational visibility

**Error Handling**
- Structured logging implementation for debugging and monitoring
- HTTP status code management for proper client communication

## External Dependencies

### Python Standard Library
- `threading` - Multi-threaded operation support
- `time` - Timing and scheduling operations
- `http.server` - HTTP server implementation
- `socketserver` - Network server framework
- `logging` - Application logging and monitoring

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
- **Users Table**: Complete user profiles with indexed fields, neurodivergent traits, preferences, and interaction history
- **Feedback Table**: User feedback and support requests with timestamps and resolution tracking
- **AI Sessions Table**: AI usage tracking and rate limiting
- **JSON Fields**: Optimized storage for arrays (photos, likes, matches, traits) with PostgreSQL JSON support
- **Indexes**: Strategic indexing on user_id, created_at, and frequently queried fields for performance

### Hosting Platform Integration
- Keep-alive service designed for platforms like Replit, Heroku, or similar
- HTTP endpoint structure compatible with uptime monitoring services
