## System Architecture

### Code Structure

The bot follows a modular design, separating concerns into distinct modules:
- **Main Entry Point (`main.py`)**: Configures and starts the bot, handles registration of handlers, and manages error handling.
- **Database Layer (`models.py`, `database_manager.py`, `db_operations.py`)**: Manages interactions with a pure PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM for User, Feedback, and AISession models. It supports full CRUD operations, advanced querying, indexing, and is designed for scalability to support 10,000+ concurrent users. JSON fields are used for arrays like photos, likes, and traits. Enhanced with city_slug column for consistent location matching and coordinate storage for distance calculations.
- **Translation System (`translations.py`)**: Centralizes all bot text in a `TEXTS` dictionary, providing bilingual support for English and Russian, including comprehensive neurodivergent trait definitions in multiple languages. Enhanced with payment-specific messaging for Telegram Stars and TON payments. It includes helper functions for language detection and text retrieval.
- **Payment System (`payment_system.py`)**: Comprehensive payment integration module supporting Telegram Stars and TON cryptocurrency payments. Handles invoice creation, payment verification, transaction monitoring via TON Center API, and payment status tracking. Includes validation, error handling, and database integration for payment records.
- **Payment Configuration (`payment_config.py`)**: Centralized configuration management for payment systems, including TON wallet setup, API credentials, and environment validation with helpful setup instructions.
- **Handler Modules (`handlers.py`)**: Contains conversation handlers for user registration, the main menu system, profile management (viewing, editing), and dating features (like/pass, match detection, profile browsing), along with navigation elements like back buttons.
- **Keep-Alive Service (`keep_alive.py`)**: A custom HTTP server that prevents the bot from going idle on hosting platforms and integrates with logging.
- **Process Management (`process_manager.py`)**: Robust system to prevent multiple bot instances from running simultaneously. Uses PID files, process monitoring, and automatic cleanup to ensure only one bot runs at a time. Includes signal handlers for graceful shutdown and automatic killing of conflicting processes.

### Translation Management

All translations are centralized in a `TEXTS` dictionary, allowing for easy management and addition of new languages. It ensures complete coverage of bot functionality and includes comprehensive multilingual support for neurodivergent traits and city normalization.

### Design Patterns

- **Service Architecture**: Modular design separates core bot operations from support services like the keep-alive function.
- **Error Handling**: Implements structured logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **Process Isolation**: Prevents multiple bot instances through robust locking mechanisms with automatic cleanup and conflict resolution.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handlers ensure proper cleanup of resources and lock files on termination.

## External Dependencies

### Python Standard Library

- `threading`
- `time`
- `http.server`
- `socketserver`
- `logging`

### Database Schema

- **PostgreSQL**: The core database.
  - **Users Table**: Stores complete user profiles, including indexed fields, neurodivergent traits, preferences, and interaction history. Utilizes PostgreSQL JSON support for arrays (photos, likes, matches, traits). Enhanced with city_slug field for consistent location matching and latitude/longitude coordinates for precise distance calculations.
  - **Feedback Table**: Records user feedback and support requests.
  - **AI Sessions Table**: Tracks AI usage and rate limiting.
  - Strategic indexing is applied to frequently queried fields for performance, including new indexes on city_slug and coordinate fields.

### Hosting Platform Integration

- The `keep-alive` service is designed for compatibility with platforms like Replit, Heroku, or similar, using HTTP endpoints for uptime monitoring.
- **Process Management**: Includes `start_bot.py` for safe bot startup with automatic cleanup of existing instances, ensuring no overlapping processes occur during restarts or deployments.
